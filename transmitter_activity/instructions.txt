- step 0) Get your IP address from `ifconfig`, en0

- step 1) Create a server that accepts POST to `/messages` and binds to the external interface(0.0.0.0).
          It accepts a json payload formatted as follows:
            { data: { ip_addrs: [127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3], id: 1, content: 'hello, world.' }}

          The server should log (puts) the original content,
          change the content (however you see fit),
          and pass it to the first IP address in data[:urls] same json format (id unchanged).
          Pop the first IP such that the outgoing list is [127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3]

          Add a `sleep(1)` call to your controller action, so we can observer the transmissions slowed down.

          Pro (Rails) tip: start your rails server with `rails s -b 0.0.0.0`
                           Add `config.log_level = :error` to development.rb

- step 2) Make the above asynchronous to allow for a new request before a response.
          Add the following (or equivalent) to your async request:
            rescue StandardError => e
              puts e.message
            end
          to observe connection timeouts.
          Add the IP addr that you pop to the end of the list.
            such that if you reveive
              { data: { urls: [127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3], id: 1, content: 'hello, world.' }}
            you should send
              { data: { urls: [127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3000, 127.0.0.1], id: 1, content: 'hello, world.' }}

- step 3) Pass the outgoing message to `/broker_messages` in addition to the original IP.
          Also change the previous error handling to send the URL of a
          timed out request as the content to `/broker_errors`.

          Remove the sleep command

- step 4) experiment with passing to multiple IPs

- step 5) Before sending, adjust the list of ips to be [ip2, ip3, ..., ip1].
          Essentially add the first IP to the end, instead of popping it off the list.

- step 6) If you get an error, you can remove that IP from the list, and continue


curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{ "data": { "id":-1, "content":"all your base are" } }' http://192.168.2.196:3000/messages
